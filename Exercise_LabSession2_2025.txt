 Manipulation using NetworkX and other python libraries

A)
  Use the version of karateClubDataset available at
https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/karateclub/tree/master/dataset/node_level/deezer

   Write a program that 
   
  a) Displays the whole graph using Gephi visualization, and highlights the node with the highest degree. 
  b) Enumerates the various components of the network and indicating the size of each component
  c) Displays the distribution (histogram) of degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, page rank centrality. 
  d) Repeat c) when using closeness centrality, betweenness centrality 
  e) Repeat c) and d) for largest component of the network
  f) Displays the local clustering coefficient of each node, and draws the corresponding distribution function for the largest component. 
  
  g) Calculates the global clustering coefficient of the overall graph (or its largest connected component). 
  h) Identify a subgraph, which is bipartie graph 


B)
Consider the eggo-Facebook dataset, available at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html  (Use only the Facebook dataset graph)

Write a program that

a) Calculates the degree, closeness and in-betweeness centrality of each node of the network, and displays the corresponding distribution (histogram)

b) Calculates the shortest distance between node (s) of highest centrality score and node (s) of second highest centrality score (for both degree, closeness, in-betweeness centraility measures)

c) Displays the subgraph where the nodes are most connected (in terms of degree centrality).. Can use your own reasoning for this issue

d) Calculates the local clustering coefficients and the shortest distance among the nodes with highest and second highest clustering coefficient.

d) Checks whether Power-law distribution is fitted
